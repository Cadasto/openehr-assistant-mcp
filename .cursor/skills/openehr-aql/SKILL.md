# openEHR AQL

When helping with AQL (writing, reviewing, or explaining queries), read and apply the project guides. Use the Read tool to load the relevant file(s) from `resources/guides/aql/`.

Key guides:

- **principles.md** — AQL semantics and containment
- **syntax.md** — syntax and path rules
- **idioms-cheatsheet.md** — common patterns
- **checklist.md** — conformance checklist

Follow the guidance in the loaded guide(s). Cross-references use `openehr://guides/aql/{name}` (same as MCP). For archetype path semantics, see also `openehr://guides/archetypes/adl-syntax`.
