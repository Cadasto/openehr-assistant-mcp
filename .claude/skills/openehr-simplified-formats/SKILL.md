# openEHR Simplified Formats

When helping with openEHR simplified formats (Flat/Structured JSON, Web Template field identifiers), read and apply the project guides. Use the Read tool to load the relevant file(s) from `resources/guides/simplified_formats/`.

Key guides:

- **principles.md** — design principles
- **rules.md** — normative rules
- **idioms-cheatsheet.md** — common patterns
- **checklist.md** — conformance checklist

Follow the guidance in the loaded guide(s). Cross-references use `openehr://guides/simplified_formats/{name}` (same as MCP).
